			<p>The death penalty has become an increasingly hot button issue in more recent years. Many have become concerned with its origins and believe it to be a racially biased institution. It is a constant battle to decide whether or not to abolish it; currently, 27 of the 50 states still allow the death penalty, but Pennsylvania, California, and Oregon have placed it under a gubernatorial moratorium. The death penalty is believed to be biased towards black people, executing them disproportionately compared to other races. While my findings are not the final answer to this question, they are here not to prove right or wrong, but to provide accurate and informative data.  </p>

			<h3>Population Comparisons</h3>
			<p>If we were to calculate the ratio per 10,000 people, the number of black people executed is three times higher than that of white people. While the numbers themselves in comparison to the population proportions are small, this hints at racial bias. Since 1976, about 1,500 people have been executed. Black people make up for about one-third of the people executed, despite making up less than one-quarter of the total U.S. population. While there are racial disaparities, it is hard to prove institutional bias. I spoke to Rick Trunfio, former Chief ADA of Onodaga County and current Syracuse University professor about why this is. "For there to be institutional racism, the government has to actually support laws that oppress people based on their race," he said. "Those laws don't exist anymore." He believes that while there are racist people in the system, the entire system is not and cannot be racist.</p>

			<h3>Death Row</h3>
			<p>As of January 1, 2023, there are 2,331 prisoners on Death Row. 41% are black, 42% are white, 14% are Latinx, and 3% are identified as "other." Since the total number of executions since 1976 is smaller and this number is more current, it is easier to find racial bias here. If we were to calculate the ratio per 10,000 people based on population, there would be six times moer black people on Death Row than white people. As seen below, black people make up 12-13% of the total United States population, but almost half of death row. 
			A study conducted by the <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/innocence">Death Penalty Information Center </a> found that, “Since 1973, 195 former death-row prisoners have been exonerated of all charges related to the wrongful convictions that had them put on death row.” 106 of those exonerated are black. However, this brings into question an idea taught by Professor Trunfio in one of his classes: Legal Innocence vs. Actual Innonce. According to him, “actual innocence means the defendant has been proven factually innocent; legal innocence means the evidence and facts prove the defendant is guilty, however, a legal error, legal issue, or procedural issue provides a basis for an appellate court to reverse the conviction.” Because the study does not say what the reason was for their convictions being overturned, it becomes a question of legal or actual innocence. </p>

			<h3 id="final">Final Findings</h3>
			<p> This topic is not black and white; there is a lot of gray area. There is a lot of debate surrounding the death penalty, a debate that I believe will continue to go on for a very long time. The numbers in my findings do suggest there is racial bias, but as mentioned in my conversation with Professor Trunfio, there may not really be institutional bias and the racism we see is reserved to specific actors within the system. It would more than likely take deep research into each individual death row case from 1976 to now to prove complete racial bias in the system. I believe that no matter how much research is done by both supporters and non-supporters, and no matter how much proof either may have, there will never be a final answer to this question. My findings are not the final answer to this topic and are only just the tip of the iceberg.
